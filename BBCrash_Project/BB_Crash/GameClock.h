	This class provides a platform-independent implementation
	for all game timing. You give it a target frame rate, and 
	then once per frame call timeGameLoop. This will clamp the 
	frame rate to your target loop. If the loop is running slower
	than the target rate, you'll have to either settle
	for a slower game, which means you should improve
	performance in other parts of the game, or you should
	scale all game movements proportionally to the
	slowdown.

	This timer works by calculating the total time a given
	frame has taken and comparing it to the target framerate.
	It will then sleep for the difference if the measured
	framerate is faster than the target.

	Note that it uses a platform independent high resolutions
	C++ timer.
